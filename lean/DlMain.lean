`oo-dlmodel AXIOMS.tsv MODEL.tsv`

Reads an axiom set and a finite interpretation, runs the verified checker, and prints one
JSON object.

Exit codes, matching the convention `oo-cert` uses:

* `0` the interpretation is a model of the axiom set. The axiom set is satisfiable, and the
  statement covering that is `Dl.satisfiable_of_checkModel`.
* `1` the interpretation is NOT a model. By `Dl.checkModel_complete` this is a statement
  about the interpretation, not about the checker giving up: the checker accepts every
  model of the axiom set.
* `2` a file could not be read or parsed. No verdict either way.

What exit 0 does NOT say, and what a reader must not infer from it:

* it says nothing about UNSATISFIABILITY. That answer has its own certificate and its own
  checker, `oo-dlrefute`, and the two must never be read for one another. This header used
  to say certifying it "needs a closed tableau with its blocking argument". Half of that
  was right. A closed tableau is what it needs. Blocking is a COMPLETENESS device, there so
  that a SEARCH for a model terminates, and a refutation never needs one: a closed tableau
  is already a finite tree whose every branch ended in a clash. `lean/Dl/Tableau.lean` is
  the proof and it carries no blocking argument anywhere;
* it says nothing about whether `AXIOMS.tsv` is the ontology. The OWL parser in
  `src/tableaux.rs` is outside the theorem, exactly as the N-Triples parser is outside
  `Shacl.validate_spec`. What is certified is a relation between the two files;
* it says nothing about the fragment the emitter refused to write. `src/tableaux.rs` emits
  nothing rather than something unchecked when the completion graph cannot be turned into a
  finite interpretation, and "no certificate" is not a verdict.

The diagnostic pass that names the first failing axiom is separate and unverified. It runs
only after the verified checker has already said no.
