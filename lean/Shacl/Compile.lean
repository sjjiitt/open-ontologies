# Compiling a shapes graph into shapes

This module turns RDF into the `Shape` datatype the proved evaluator consumes. It
is NOT part of any theorem, and that is the design, not an omission: a compiler
from RDF into an abstract syntax is a parser, and the project's existing position on
parsers is that a parse error rejects rather than accepts.

## It fails closed, and that is the only reason it can be trusted at all

The dangerous failure for a validator is to ignore a constraint it does not
understand and report `conforms`. So:

* **Every `sh:` predicate on every shape the compiler walks must be known.** One it
  has not implemented is an error naming the predicate, not a silently dropped
  constraint. `ignoredParams` lists the handful that carry no conformance meaning,
  each with a reason.
* **A shapes graph that defines a constraint COMPONENT is refused outright.** A
  custom component introduces parameters in the user's own namespace, so the
  `sh:` check above cannot see them, and a shape using one would look empty. The
  guard is a scan for `sh:parameter`, `sh:validator`, `sh:nodeValidator`,
  `sh:propertyValidator`, `sh:sparql` and `rdf:type sh:ConstraintComponent`
  anywhere in the shapes graph.
* **Recursion is refused.** SHACL says it "does not define the semantics of
  recursive shape definitions". `Shape` is an inductive type, so a cyclic shapes
  graph exhausts the nesting budget and is reported as recursive.
* **A malformed shape is refused**, not guessed at: two `sh:path` values, a
  `sh:minCount` on a shape with no path, an RDF list that does not end at
  `rdf:nil`.

Every refusal comes out as `undetermined` in the report and in the conformance
measurement, which counts it separately from a pass and from a failure.

## What is deliberately ignored, and why it is safe here

`sh:message`, `sh:name`, `sh:description`, `sh:order`, `sh:group` and
`sh:defaultValue` carry no conformance meaning at all.

`sh:severity` does carry meaning, for `sh:resultSeverity` in the report. It is
ignored, so every result this validator produces is a violation with no severity
recorded. That is a real gap and it is named here rather than discovered: a report
consumer that acts on severity must not use this validator.

What is no longer true is that the gap is INVISIBLE from the output.
`ignoredPairs` collects every `(subject, predicate)` pair in the shapes graph
whose predicate this list waves through, and the verdict carries it, so a reader
of the JSON alone learns that a severity or a message was present and dropped.
That is the defect issue #206 named: not the ignoring, which is honest, but the
silence, in the one place a compiler whose rule is refuse rather than guess
discarded instead.

header.

Adding a predicate here is enough to make it appear in the report's `ignored`
list, because `ignoredPairs` reads THIS list. There is no second place to
update, and `tests/shacl_ignored_is_named_test.rs` reads this list out of the
source rather than typing the IRIs, so a predicate added here without reaching
the report turns that file red. -/

/-- Every `(subject, predicate)` pair in the shapes graph whose predicate this
compiler IGNORES: present, read past, and with no effect on the verdict or on
any result field.

This exists because discarding in silence is the one place the compiler broke
the rule the rest of it keeps. A predicate in neither `knownParams` nor
`ignoredParams` is REFUSED with a reason; a predicate in `ignoredParams`
vanished, and a shapes graph that marked a constraint `sh:Warning` produced
byte-identical output to one that marked it `sh:Violation`. A reader could not
learn from the output that anything had been dropped. Now they can.

It is a filter over the graph and NOT a trace of the compiler's reads, and the
difference is worth stating rather than glossing. The compiler visits targeted
nodes and the shapes nested inside them, so a pair sitting on a node nothing
targets appears here and was never read. It had no effect either, which is the
fact a reader of this list wants, so both readings of "ignored" agree on the
answer while disagreeing on the route.

It reads `ignoredParams`, the same list `compileShape` waves through, so the
report and the compiler cannot drift apart: a predicate added to that list
starts appearing here on the same build.

Nothing here touches `Shacl.validate_spec`. The verdict is unchanged, because
none of these predicates ever affected it; what changes is that the report now
says so. -/

and `sh:oneOrMorePath` are the two forms refused; see `Shape.lean` for why.

A node carrying TWO path forms is refused rather than read as either. SHACL
requires a well-formed path node to have exactly one form, and the suite's
`core/path/path-strange-001` is a node that is simultaneously a sequence path and
an inverse path. Reading it as the first form the code happens to check is how this
compiler produced its one wrong answer against the suite: it chose the inverse
reading and blamed the wrong node. Refusing an ill-formed shapes graph and saying
so is the answer that cannot be wrong, and it stays refused now that sequence paths
ARE implemented: the Working Group's expected report reads that node as a sequence,
but the shapes graph does not say so and this compiler will not pick.
