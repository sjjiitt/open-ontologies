//!
//! One `FolProblem`, three files, ONE question. The solver's file and
//! `problem.tsv` are both folds over `FolProblem::checker_entries`, so the
//! thing the solver is asked and the thing the checker checks cannot drift
//! apart by construction rather than by care.
//!
//! # The verdict discipline, which is the reason this exists
//!
//! Decision 0006 item 4 fixes five fields and five verdict words, and this
//! module is where they are computed. The rules are mechanical, and
//! `tests/fol_solver_verdict_test.rs` fails if any of them is ever relaxed.
//! Since the verdict-by-construction change they are also UNREPRESENTABLE
//! otherwise: the verdict is a [`crate::verdict::FolVerdict`], its certified
//! variant carries a [`crate::verdict::Certified`], and that type has no
//! public constructor. The rules restated, with what now enforces each:
//!
//! 1. `model_checked` requires `checker_exit == 0`. It is not a string in this
//!    file any more. `FolVerdict::ModelChecked` takes evidence that only
//!    `CheckerRun::accepted` returns, and only on a zero exit code from a
//!    process this crate spawned. A new code path cannot write that word.
//! 2. `unsatisfiable_oracle` requires a run whose emitted problem carried NO
//!    cardinality constraint. It is written only in the arm that reads the
//!    unbounded probe's answer. A bounded run's `unsat` is
//!    `no_model_up_to_size_k`, which is not unsatisfiability: the formula
//!    `∀x∃y (r(x,y) ∧ x≠y)` is unsat at carrier 1 and sat at carrier 2.
//! 3. `owl_reading` is non-null only when the CHECKER reported
//!    `goal_negated_present` and the verdict is `model_checked`. It is read
//!    back out of the checker's own JSON rather than taken from this side's
//!    intention, and it carries its own long word,
//!    `not_entailed_under_unproved_translation`, which must never be shortened
//!    to "not entailed": the OWL-level reading rides on `OwlLean.adequacy` in
//!    a sibling project AND on the Rust-to-Lean correspondence that decision
//!    0005 item 2 states is pinned by tests and NOT proved.
//!
//! # A rejected model is a stop-the-line event
//!
//! If a solver answers `sat` and the verified checker then REJECTS the
//! structure, two things that are supposed to agree do not. Either the solver
//! is wrong, or the ingestion misread it, or the SMT-LIB/LADR printer does not
//! say what `problem.tsv` says. None of those is a fact about the ontology, so
//! the verdict stays `satisfiable_oracle` exactly as decision 0006 item 5
//! requires and is NEVER `rejected` as though the ontology were at fault.
//!
//! But it is not a quiet fallback either. It is reported in its own
//! [`Disagreement`] block with `severity: STOP_THE_LINE`, it is counted in the
//! run summary, and it makes the command exit non-zero — the same treatment
//! `tools/shacl_differential.py` gives a FALSE_CLEAN, and for the same reason:
//! a disagreement between a checker and the thing it is checking is the one
//! result that must fail a pipeline rather than be filed under "other".
//!
//! # What a green run does NOT say
//!
//! Nothing about unsatisfiability unless the word `unsatisfiable_oracle` is
//! printed, and that word is an ORACLE's, never a certificate's. The absence
//! of a finite model implies nothing: SHIQ lacks the finite model property, so
//! a satisfiable ontology can have only infinite models and will never receive
//! a certificate here. That is a limitation of the method and it is the honest
//! counterweight to the asymmetry the layer is built on.
