// ── The rules that conclude `false` ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Seventeen rules of the OWL 2 RL profile conclude `false` rather than a
// triple: `eq-diff1`, `eq-diff2`, `eq-diff3`, `prp-irp`, `prp-asyp`,
// `prp-pdw`, `prp-adp`, `prp-npa1`, `prp-npa2`, `cls-nothing2`, `cls-com`,
// `cls-maxc1`, `cls-maxqc1`, `cls-maxqc2`, `cax-dw`, `cax-adc` and
// `dt-not-type`. (Seventeen is the count extracted mechanically from the W3C
// tables, and `lean/OOCert/Refute.lean` now agrees; it said sixteen until the
// list was checked against the source. `dt-not-type` is the one that is not
// merely absent from the Lean but INEXPRESSIBLE there, because that semantics
// has no datatype value space and a literal is its spelling like any other
// term.)
//
// None of them is in the fixpoint's rule table, and none of them could be:
// `Derivation.conclusion` is a triple. They are looked for HERE, once, over
// the closure the fixpoint reached, and reported in the separate `oo-refute/1`
// format.
//
// **Twelve of the seventeen can now be certified, and this engine finds ten of
// those twelve.** `OOCert.RefuteConditions` in `lean/OOCert/Refute.lean` carries
// twelve semantic fields and `OOCert.checkRefuteStep` twelve arms, so a
// refutation naming any of the twelve is CHECKED rather than refused. It used to
// carry one.
//
// The two numbers differ and the difference is not a defect. `cls-maxqc1` and
// `cls-maxqc2` have a condition in the Lean and no detector here: the checker
// would accept a refutation naming them, and this engine never writes one,
// because nothing looks for them. The five that have no condition at all are
// `cax-adc`, `prp-adp`, `eq-diff2` and `eq-diff3`, which state their members in
// an RDF list that the step format cannot carry, and `dt-not-type`, which needs
// a datatype value space this development does not have. The first four are NOT
// IMPLEMENTED and the fifth is NOT EXPRESSIBLE.
//
// A clash of a rule outside the twelve is still an engine opinion with nothing
// behind it, still reported under a different word from the certified one, and
// still written to no refutation file.

/// One way the closure contradicts itself: the OWL 2 RL rule that concludes
/// `false` from it, and the premises that rule reads, in the order the W3C
/// table writes them (which is also the order `OOCert.checkRefuteStep` matches

// The built-in rules, as data
//
// TCB-14 used to read: "`OOCert.checkStep` pattern-matches the premises
// positionally per rule. The emitter passes them in a hand-written order at
// each of the thirty-one `emit` call sites. A wrong order is a rejection, not a
// false pass, and `tests/lean_certificate_test.rs` covers every rule, but
// nothing derives the order from a single source."
//
// This is the single source. Each rule is a pattern over numbered variables,
// in the order `lean/OOCert/Rules.lean` matches them, and the emitter computes
// both the premise list AND the conclusion from it. A call site supplies the
// BINDING and nothing else, so it has no order to get wrong: the twenty-seven
// fixed-arity rules cannot drift from the checker by a mistake at the site.
// `tests/lean_certificate_test.rs` still runs the real checker over the corpus,
// and `tests/premise_order_test.rs` parses the arms out of `Rules.lean` and
// compares them with this table, so a change to either side that the other does
// not follow fails at `cargo test` rather than at a user's certificate.
//
// The four list rules (`cls-int1`, `cls-int2`, `cls-uni`, `cls-oo`) are not
// here. Their premises include an RDF list chain whose length is the length of
// the list, so they are not a fixed pattern and the checker matches them with
// `takeChain` rather than positionally. They keep an explicit premise vector
// and say so at the site.

/// What is deliberately NOT here, with the reason, because "not implemented" and

///
///   * `eq-ref` is sound and useless. It asserts `owl:sameAs` reflexivity for
///     every term in every position. Measured on the largest file this
///     repository ships, `benchmark/oaei/data/anatomy/human.owl`, that is
///     17,194 triples of no consequence added to a graph of 35,354. It would
///     also put a derivation into the empty-graph case that
///     `OOCert.not_everything_is_entailed` depends on staying empty.
///   * The `eq-rep-s`, `eq-rep-p`, `eq-rep-o` family is sound and quadratic in
///     the size of a `owl:sameAs` clique. Counted by SPARQL over every RDF file
///     this repository tracks that parses and is under the size cap, the corpus
///     contains ZERO `owl:sameAs` triples, so the cost is certain and the
///     benefit here is nothing at all. Three files mention `sameAs` inside an
///     `rdfs:comment` and none of them asserts one.
///   * `scm-cls`, `scm-op` and `scm-dp` are sound and emit reflexive trivia
///     (`c rdfs:subClassOf c`, `c owl:equivalentClass c`) of exactly the kind
///     the `a != b` guards elsewhere in this file exist to suppress.
///   * The `dt-*` family needs a datatype VALUE space. `OOCert.Semantics`
///     reads a literal as its N-Triples spelling and says so, so there is no
///     condition here for those rules to be sound against.
///   * Nothing concludes `false`. Every rule above concludes a triple, which
///     is what the `oo-cert/1` format can carry. The seventeen rules of the
///     profile that conclude `false` are handled AFTER the fixpoint instead,
///     by [`find_clashes`], and written in the separate `oo-refute/1` format
///     that `lean/OOCert/Refute.lean` checks. Only `cax-dw` earns a

// ── User-supplied Horn rules ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything above this line applies a rule set this file hardcodes. The
// checker in `lean/OOCert/Horn.lean` accepts a certificate over ANY rule table,
// proved once by `OOCert.horn_certificate_sound`, and until now nothing could
// produce one: the generic layer had a consumer and no producer, and a user
// with a rule table had nothing to hand it.
//
// What follows reads a rule table in the `rules.tsv` format
// `OOCert.HornParse.parseRules` accepts, evaluates it to a fixpoint over the
// loaded graph, and writes a certificate in the `horn.tsv` format
// `OOCert.HornParse.parseHornSteps` accepts.
//
// # This path states no verdict, and that is deliberate
//
// A certificate over the built-in table earns `entailed`: true in every model
// of the asserted graph, because `OOCert.Builtin.asHorn_sound` discharges those
// rules against the semantics. A certificate over a table a user wrote earns
// `entailed_under_supplied_rules`: true in every model of the graph THAT ALSO
// SATISFIES THOSE RULES. The rules are assumed and never checked, so a rule
// reading "every supplier is compliant" produces steps that check green for
// ever.
//
// `oo-horn` decides which of the two a run earned, by comparing the table it
// was given against the built-in one. This engine does not repeat that
// judgement in its own output and does not print either verdict word, because a
// second place where the two could be confused is exactly the hazard decision
// 0003 exists to prevent. What the engine reports is the table it used, a
// hash of it, and the command that pronounces.
