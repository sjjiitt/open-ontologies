//! Does adding these axioms change anything I could already say?
//!
//! [`crate::closure_diff`] already computes `closure(G) \ closure(P)` for a
//! `P ⊆ G`, with the rule and the premises behind every row and the
//! monotonicity gate running for free. Conservativity is that computation
//! pointed the other way: take `G` to be the EXTENDED ontology and `P` to be
//! the one that was there before, and the difference is exactly the set of
//! consequences the extension introduced. Restrict it to the old signature and
//! the finding is "this change alters what the ontology says about terms that
//! already existed".
//!
//! Nothing here recomputes a closure, a certificate or a verdict word:
//! [`crate::closure_diff::SourceClosure`] does all of it, so there is still
//! exactly ONE place in this crate where `checked` is produced.
//!
//! # What this is NOT, said once here and again in the payload
//!
//! Deductive conservativity in a description logic is a different problem from
//! the one this file solves, and it is a hard one: ExpTime-complete for `EL`,
//! 2ExpTime-complete for `ALC` (Ghilardi, Lutz and Wolter, KR 2006, "Did I
//! Damage My Ontology?"), and UNDECIDABLE for `ALCQIO` (Lutz, Walther and
//! Wolter, IJCAI 2007). Model conservativity is stronger again and is
//! undecidable already for `EL` (Lutz and Wolter, JSC 2010).
//!
//! What is computed here is conservativity WITH RESPECT TO THE RULE TABLE the
//! engine evaluates, which is a Horn approximation of OWL and derives only
//! positive ground triples. It is sound in one direction only and the report
//! says so in a field, not a doc comment: a new consequence found IS a real
//! change to what the ontology derives, while finding none does NOT establish
//! that the extension is conservative in any description logic. The field is
//! called `conservative_under_rule_table` and there is deliberately no
//! `conservative` anywhere in the payload.
