//! Reading the derivation a prover emits, and re-checking what can honestly be
//! re-checked.
//!
//! Decision 0005 item 5 says an ATP verdict is an ORACLE OPINION, and decision
//! 0006 says a refutation is not a certificate. Neither sentence is retracted
//! here, and this module does not move the boundary: what it does is stop the
//! oracle's answer being a single word. A prover that says `SZS status Theorem`
//! also prints, on request, the derivation it found. That derivation is a
//! finite object. Reading it back turns one unexaminable word into evidence
//! that can be inspected, and some of it into evidence that can be RECOMPUTED.
//!
//! # The three things this earns, in increasing order of what they cost
//!
//! 1. **The prover refuted OUR problem.** Every leaf of the derivation is
//!    matched, by name and by parsed formula, against the problem file this
//!    repository's exporter produced. A prover pointed at the wrong file, a
//!    stale file, or a file whose conjecture was smuggled in as an axiom is
//!    caught here and nowhere else in this codebase. This is the cheapest
//!    check and by some distance the most valuable, because it is the one that
//!    an `AGREE` row in `tools/fol_differential.py` silently assumed.
//! 2. **The derivation is a well-founded DAG ending in `$false`.** Every
//!    parent reference resolves to a node that exists, the parent relation is
//!    acyclic, and the node nothing else cites is the empty clause.
//! 3. **Some steps are replayed.** Binary resolution, factoring, duplicate
//!    literal removal, trivial inequality removal, equality resolution,
//!    associative flattening and the negation of the conjecture are recomputed
//!    from the premises with a small unifier and compared with what the prover
//!    printed. Everything else is NAMED AND COUNTED as unchecked.
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! It is not a proof of unsatisfiability, and no word in the report says it
//! is. Three separate reasons, all of them live:
//!
//! - **The calculus is not verified.** Even a derivation whose every step this
//!   module recomputes is only a derivation in a calculus whose soundness is
//!   written down nowhere in `lean/`. `Fol.satisfiable_of_check` has a theorem
//!   behind it; this has a Rust program behind it.
//! - **The replayer is not verified either.** The unifier below is ordinary
//!   Rust with ordinary tests. A bug in it makes a wrong step look right.
//! - **Clausification is not checked at all.** `cnf_transformation`,
//!   `ennf_transformation`, `nnf_transformation`, skolemisation, AVATAR
//!   splitting and every SAT-solver step are unchecked and are reported as
//!   unchecked, by rule, with a count. On a real proof they are the majority
//!   of the steps, which is why [`Report::verdict`] reaches
//!   `refutation_partially_replayed` and stops there.
//!
//! The strongest word this module can print is `refutation_fully_replayed`,
//! it requires that NOTHING was left unchecked, and it still is not
//! `unsatisfiable`. The ladder exists so that the distance between what was
//! read and what was recomputed is visible in the output rather than in a
//! footnote.
//!
//! # Why a failed reconstruction is its own word
//!
//! A step whose rule this module implements, whose premises and conclusion are
//! clause-shaped, and which still does not reconstruct is EITHER a defect in
//! the derivation OR a gap in this checker. It is reported as
//! `refutation_step_not_reconstructed` and never as either of those two, for
//! the same reason `tools/fol_differential.py` reports a disagreement and does
//! not adjudicate it. Collapsing it into "unchecked" would let a forged step
//! hide behind a rule name, and collapsing it into "rejected" would claim a
//! defect in someone else's prover on this module's word alone.
//!
//! # Subsumption resolution is checked as binary resolution, and that is exact
//!
//! Vampire prints `forward_subsumption_resolution` for a step whose premises
//! are `C ∨ L` and `D ∨ ¬L'` and whose conclusion is `C`, where `D'σ ⊆ C`. The
//! binary resolvent of those two premises is `C ∪ D'σ`, and `D'σ ⊆ C` makes
//! that exactly `C`. So the conclusion of a subsumption resolution IS the
//! binary resolvent of its premises, and one check covers both rules without
//! weakening either. The same identity is why the check still passes on
//! AVATAR's printed clauses, where the side premise's assertion literals are
//! carried into the conclusion and the classical side condition does not hold
//! of the printed form.
