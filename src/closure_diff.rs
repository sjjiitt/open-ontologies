//! Entailment preservation under graph projection, by closure difference.
//!
//! [`crate::projection_entailment`] asks the question of a SUPPLIED set of
//! goals: the online form, for auditing one answer. This module supplies no
//! goals and computes the whole thing: reason both graphs to a fixpoint under
//! the same rule table and report `closure(G) \ closure(P)`. That is the form
//! an offline audit of a retrieval STRATEGY needs, because a strategy is not
//! evaluated against one question, it is evaluated against every conclusion it
//! could ever be asked to ground.
//!
//! Everything shared with the goal-directed form is shared rather than
//! re-implemented: the certificate index, the checker runner, the subset
//! precondition, the skolemiser and the monotonicity differential all live in
//! [`crate::projection_entailment`], so there is exactly ONE place in this
//! crate where a verdict word is produced.
//!
//! # Replacing a ratio with a count would reproduce the disease
//!
//! `closure(G) \ closure(P)` is enormous by construction: `P` is a slice, so
//! the difference is nearly all of `closure(G)`, and it grows with `|G|`.
//! Minimising it means retrieving MORE, which is the same perverse gradient
//! wearing a better name. The headline is therefore
//! `lost_in_projection_vocabulary`: a lost entailment is dangerous exactly when
//! every one of its terms occurs in `P`, because then an answer grounded in `P`
//! is a claim over those terms and could have rested on it. That number has its
//! own gaming direction, shrinking `terms(P)` shrinks it, and the report says
//! so in the payload rather than only in the docs.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! `closure(G)` is the expensive half and `G` does not change between retrieval
//! strategies, so [`SourceClosure::build`] is paid once and [`SourceClosure::diff`]
//! is run N times. The cache is the certificate directory: `asserted.tsv` and
//! `derivations.tsv` already exist, are already the format, and `oo-cert` has
//! already been run over them. [`SourceClosure::load`] RE-RUNS the checker
//! rather than trusting a verdict read off disk, because a cached verdict would
//! be an unchecked result wearing the checked word one indirection away.
