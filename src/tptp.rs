//! First-order export: hand an ontology to the automated-theorem-proving
//! ecosystem, in TPTP FOF and in ISO/IEC 24707 CLIF.
//!
//! # What makes this different from every other OWL-to-FOL exporter
//!
//! A sibling project, `owl-lean`, carries a machine-checked adequacy theorem
//! for an OWL-to-first-order translation: `OwlLean.adequacy`, with axiom
//! footprint `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, no `sorry` and no
//! Mathlib. Everyone else's exporter is validated empirically (FOWL, over 168
//! ChEBI modules) or proved on paper (Hets, via the institution satisfaction
//! condition). The translation in this file is written to be the SAME
//! translation that theorem is about, function for function, so a reader can
//! cite a kernel-checked result about what the emitted file means.
//!
//! `adequacy` says, for an ontology `O` and an axiom `a`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Entails O a  ↔  FOL.Entails (background ++ indAxioms inds ++ O.map trAx) (trAx a)
//! ```
//!
//! given `hinds : ∀ x : S.Ind, x ∈ inds`, i.e. `inds` enumerates the whole
//! individual vocabulary of the signature.
//!
//! # The correspondence is PINNED BY TESTS AND IS NOT ITSELF PROVED
//!
//! This is Rust and that is Lean. Nothing mechanically checks that
//! `Translation::concept` below is `OwlLean.tr`, or that `Translation::axiom`
//! is `OwlLean.trAx`. What exists is
//! `tests/fol_translation_correspondence_test.rs`, which takes worked cases,
//! computes the expected formula by hand from `OwlLean/Translation.lean`, and
//! pins the emitted string against it. If the Rust and the Lean drift apart,
//! that test is the only thing that will notice. Read the claim as: the
//! translation is the one the theorem is about, up to a test suite, not up to
//! a proof.
//!
//! # The two things the theorem needs, and how they are handled here
//!
//! ## Freshness
//!
//! `tr` allocates bound variables from a counter, and `tr_bridge` needs
//! `Fresh n x`, that is `x < n`: the subject variable must lie strictly below
//! the counter. It is not bookkeeping.
//! `OwlLean.Refutations.tr_bridge_needs_freshness` is a machine-checked
//! countermodel in which the translation of `∃r.⊤` at subject `0` with counter
//! `0` captures its own subject, so the formula stops saying "`a` has an
//! `r`-successor" and starts saying "something is `r`-related to itself".
//!
//! How this file handles it: the exporter never picks a counter. Every entry
//! into the concept translation goes through [`Translation::concept_fresh`],
//! which returns `Err` unless `x < counter`, and the four call sites reproduce
//! `trAx`'s own choices (`tr c 0 2`, `tr c 1 2`, `tr c 0 1`) rather than
//! inventing them. An edit that changes a counter fails a test instead of
//! silently emitting a captured formula.
//!
//! ## Individual typing axioms
//!
//! Nothing in `background` forces a constant to denote an OBJECT, so an
//! arbitrary first-order model may interpret an individual name outside
//! `thing`. `OwlLean.Refutations.adequacy_needs_ind_axioms` refutes the
//! left-to-right direction of adequacy outright with the empty ontology and
//! the axiom `⊤(a)`: the countermodel `Mbad` sends the name to a literal. The
//! fix is `indAxioms`, i.e. `Thing(a)` for every individual name. This was a
//! real defect found while proving the theorem, not a hypothetical.
//!
//! How this file handles it: [`FolProblem::ind_axioms`] emits `thing(i)` for
//! every individual in the signature, and the signature is built from exactly
//! the individual names occurring in the exported axioms and in the goal. The
//! theorem's hypothesis is `∀ x : S.Ind, x ∈ inds`, which holds here because
//! `S.Ind` IS the occurring set by construction. (`owl-lean`'s README lists
//! weakening that hypothesis to "the occurring vocabulary" as open work; the
//! exporter sits on the side of the gap where the hypothesis is satisfied.)
//! `tests/fol_translation_correspondence_test.rs` reconstructs the `Mbad`
//! scenario and fails if the typing axiom is ever absent.
//!
//! # What an ATP's answer is worth
//!
//! Nothing here certifies anything. A derivation certificate from the
//! forward-chaining reasoner can be checked because `lean/` holds a checker
//! whose soundness is a theorem (decision 0002). A superposition refutation
//! cannot: checking one needs a verified first-order calculus with
//! unification, which does not exist in core Lean. So when E or Vampire says
//! "Theorem", that is an ORACLE OPINION, exactly like pyshacl's verdict in
//! `tools/shacl_differential.py`, and `tools/fol_differential.py` reports
//! disagreement rather than adjudicating it. The word "proved" does not appear
//! next to an ATP verdict anywhere in this codebase.
//!
//! # The quoting trap, which points opposite ways in the two syntaxes
//!
//! [`fof::quoted`] uses SINGLE-quoted TPTP atoms and [`clif::enclosed`] uses
//! DOUBLE-quoted CLIF enclosed names. That is not an inconsistency and it is
//! the reverse of what most people assume, so both halves are written down.
//!
//! In TPTP a single-quoted atom is an ordinary constant, and a DOUBLE-quoted
//! string is a "distinct object", which is pairwise unequal to every other
//! distinct object by fiat. Had the TPTP printer used double quotes for IRIs it
//! would have silently asserted that all individuals are pairwise distinct.
//! OWL has no unique name assumption, so that would make every `owl:sameAs`
//! export unsound, and the file would still parse and still prove things.
//!
//! In CLIF the polarity flips. A single-quoted string is an INTERPRETED name
//! that denotes itself, and a double-quoted enclosed name is an ordinary
//! interpretable name, which is why A.2.2.4 recommends the enclosed-name
//! syntax for writing IRIs. Using single quotes for IRIs there would take the
//! text out of the subdialect A.4.2 calls exactly semantically conformant.
//!
//! So: single quotes in TPTP, double quotes in CLIF, for the same IRI, for
//! opposite reasons.
//!
//! # Several serialisers, one translation
//!
//! [`Form`] is computed once. [`fof`], [`clif`], [`cgif`], [`smtlib`] and
//! [`ladr`] are renderings of it and contain no OWL-specific logic at all;
//! each is a fold over `Form`. Two of them are Common Logic dialects: ISO/IEC
//! 24707 defines CLIF, CGIF and XCL, and emitting one and calling that Common
//! Logic support is a partial claim. CGIF is emitted in its CORE dialect and
//! in the compact sub-dialect clause 7.1.1 names; see [`cgif`]. CLIF is
//! restricted to the first-order-equivalent fragment of Common Logic on
//! purpose: no sequence markers, fixed arity at every position, no
//! quantification into a predicate position. Common Logic is NOT plain
//! first-order logic, and the adequacy theorem is about a translation into
//! plain first-order logic, so anything outside that fragment would sit
//! outside the theorem. [`Form`] cannot express the excluded constructs, which
//! is the structural reason the restriction holds; `clif_uses_only_fol_fragment`
//! in the correspondence test is the check that it still holds.

// ── The clausal fragment, and CNF for it ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Decision 0005 says a superposition refutation cannot be certified because it
// needs a verified first-order calculus with unification. `lean/Fo` now has the
// resolution half of one, and `tstp::to_fo_certificate` feeds it a prover's
// derivation. The gap that remained was CLAUSIFICATION: a prover handed `fof`
// clausifies before it resolves, and clausification is not resolution, so the
// translation reached nothing. Measured on real exports, a FOF problem
// translated 0 of 8 steps and the same problem as CNF translated 2 of 2.
//
// The fix is not to clausify better. It is to NOT MAKE THE PROVER DO IT, and
// the measurement says when that is free.
//
// ## What needs a Skolem function, and what does not
//
// Measured over three exported ontologies, 1,905 formulas:
//
//   * `? [X0] : thing(X0)` — the non-empty-domain axiom. Exactly one per
//     export, always the same formula, never derived from an ontology axiom.
//   * `someValuesFrom` in SUPERCLASS position, `A ⊑ ∃r.B`. 126 in an OWL DL
//     ontology, ZERO in both OWL 2 RL ones.
//   * Everything else — 1,422 of 1,423 in one of them — has no existential at
//     all, so there is nothing to Skolemise.
//
// That zero is not luck. **OWL 2 RL forbids an existential restriction in
// superclass position**, because it is not clausal. So for the profile this
// engine's certificate layer already covers, clausification is NNF plus
// distribution: a truth-preserving EQUIVALENCE, needing no Skolemisation
// theorem and no argument about choice over models.
//
// So the exporter asks which fragment it is in and says so, rather than
// promising CNF it cannot always give.

/// over it can be certified end to end.

// ── Serialiser 3: ISO/IEC 24707 CGIF ────────────────────────────────────────

/// CGIF rendering of [`Form`]: **core CGIF**, in a compact sub-dialect.
///
/// ISO/IEC 24707 Common Logic has three dialects, and Common Logic conformance
/// is a claim about the language and not about one serialisation of it. This
/// engine emitted CLIF only, which made its Common Logic support partial in a
/// way nothing said out loud. This module is the second of the three. XCL,
/// Annex C, is still not emitted and is named in the docs as absent.
///
/// # Core, not extended, and what that costs
///
/// B.3.1 lists what extended CGIF adds to core: type labels and type
/// expressions on concepts, `@every` for universal quantification, the Boolean
/// contexts `[If: … [Then: …]]`, `[Either: [Or: …]]` and
/// `[Equiv: [Iff: …]]`, concepts in an arc sequence, actors with zero or
/// several output arcs, and importing a text into a text. **None of that is
/// emitted here.** Everything below is core CGIF (B.2), which B.4 states is a
/// fully conformant CL dialect in its own right: "every CL sentence can be
/// translated to a semantically equivalent sentence in each of them".
///
/// Core costs exactly one thing in readability. A core concept has no type
/// field, so `[Cat: *x]` is not available and a class membership is written as
/// an ordinary relation. B.1.2 gives that reduction itself: "The concept
/// `[Go:*x]`, for example, becomes an untyped concept `[*x]` and a conceptual
/// relation `(Go ?x)`." That reduction is the whole difference, and taking it
/// means the file needs no Annex B.3 rewrite pass to be read.
///
/// # The restriction, in the standard's own vocabulary
///
/// Clause 7.1.1 names three sub-dialects, and this emitter is all three:
///
/// * a **compact sub-dialect**, "a dialect that does not recognize sequence
///   markers". That is the restriction that matters: clause 6.5 says Common
///   Logic with sequence markers "is not compact, and therefore not
///   first-order", and the adequacy theorem is about plain first-order logic.
///   No `[*...x]` and no `?...x` is emitted, in either position the grammar
///   allows one (B.2.5's `existentialConcept`, B.2.3's `arcSequence`).
/// * an **unstructured sub-dialect**, "a dialect that does not recognize
///   titlings and importation statements".
/// * a **single domain sub-dialect**, "a dialect that does not recognize
///   domain restrictions".
///
/// Two further exclusions have no clause-7 name and are listed because they
/// would leave first-order logic just as surely:
///
/// * **no `#?` type label.** B.2.7's `ordinaryRelation` admits `["#", "?"],
///   CGname`, and its own comment says why: "By allowing the type label of a
///   conceptual relation to be a bound label, CGIF supports the CL ability to
///   quantify over relations and functions." That is quantifying into a
///   predicate position, and it is the CGIF spelling of the thing the CLIF
///   restriction already excludes.
/// * **no actors.** B.2.1's `actor` is how a CL FUNCTION is written. `OwlLean.
///   FOL`'s `FSig` has P1, P2 and Const and no function symbol of positive
///   arity, so [`Form`] cannot express one and none is emitted.
///
/// [`Form`] cannot express any of the five, which is the structural reason the
/// restriction holds; `cgif_stays_in_the_compact_first_order_sub_dialect` in
/// `tests/fol_cgif_export_test.rs` is the check that it still does.
///
/// # The core encoding, production by production
///
/// | `Form` | CGIF | why |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `App1(p,t)` | `(p t)` | B.2.7 `ordinaryRelation` |
/// | `App2(p,t,u)` | `(p t u)` | the same, at arity two |
/// | `Eq(t,u)` | `[: t u]` | B.2.5 `coreferenceConcept`. CGIF has NO equality relation |
/// | `Tru` | `[]` | B.2.5: "an empty context `[ ]` is translated to CLIF as `(and)`, which is true by definition" |
/// | `Fls` | `~[]` | B.2.8: "The negation of the blank CG, written `~[ ]`, is always false" |
/// | `Neg(g)` | `~[ g ]` | B.2.8 `negation = "~", context` |
/// | `And(g,h)` | `g h` | juxtaposition. B.2.6 makes a CG's nodes a conjunction |
/// | `Or(g,h)` | `~[ ~[g] ~[h] ]` | B.3.5's own `eitherOr` rewrite into core |
/// | `Imp(g,h)` | `~[ g ~[h] ]` | B.3.5's own `ifThen` rewrite into core |
/// | `All(n,g)` | `~[ [*Xn] ~[g] ]` | B.3.7's `@every` rewrite: a nest of two negations |
/// | `Ex(n,g)` | `[ [*Xn] g ]` | B.2.6: a CG with existential concepts is `∃names. rest` |
///
/// The three derived forms are not this project's inventions. B.3.5 gives
/// `ifThen` as `"~[", CG(ante), "~[", CG(conse), "]", "]"` and `eitherOr` as a
/// negation containing one `~[…]` per disjunct, and B.3.7 says of a CG
/// containing universal concepts that "the output string shall be a nest of two
/// negations. The outer context shall contain the translations of all the
/// universal concepts, and the inner context shall contain the translations of
/// all other nodes". This module emits what the standard's own rewrite rules
/// produce.
///
/// # Every binder gets its own context, and why that is not decoration
///
/// B.2.10: "If a concept x with a defining label with name n is directly
/// contained in some context c, then c shall not contain any concept other than
/// x with a defining label with the same CG name n." Two things follow, and
/// both bite.
///
/// **An existential is emitted as `[ [*Xn] … ]` and never as a bare `[*Xn]`
/// juxtaposed with its body.** `OwlLean.trAx` restarts its variable counter for
/// each axiom and reuses indices between an axiom's antecedent and its
/// consequent (`tr c 0 2` and `tr d 0 2` are both called at 2), so two `[*X2]`
/// really can arise in one sentence. Giving each binder a context of its own
/// means no context ever directly contains two defining labels at all, whatever
/// the counter did.
///
/// Renumbering would also have fixed it and is forbidden: `owl-lean` uses named
/// variables rather than de Bruijn indices precisely so that freshness is a
/// proof obligation, and an exporter that renumbered would be emitting a
/// different formula.
///
/// **Each sentence is wrapped in a context of its own** for the same reason at
/// the file level, so nothing a sentence binds can reach the next sentence.
/// `[ s ]` is `(and s)`, which is `s`.
///
/// **Shadowing is avoided rather than relied on.** B.2.10 says both that a
/// context "shall not contain any concept other than x with a defining label
/// with the same CG name n" — where *contains* is transitive — and, in the very
/// next sentence, that a nested context may redeclare one. The two cannot both
/// hold. This emitter never produces a defining label inside the scope of
/// another with the same name, so it does not depend on which reading is right,
/// and `no_defining_label_is_ever_shadowed` is the check.
///
/// # Names
///
/// B.1.1's `identifier = letter, {letter | digit | "_"}` is far narrower than
/// CLIF's `namecharsequence`: no colon, no slash, no dot, no hyphen. An IRI is
/// therefore ALWAYS written as a double-quoted enclosed name, including in the
/// text's name slot, where the CLIF writer emits a bare IRI for Macleod's sake.
/// B.1.1 states the rule: "the category CGname requires that all CLIF name
/// sequences except those in the CGIF category identifier shall be enclosed in
/// quotes".
///
/// `X0`, `X1`, … and the bare `thing` and `lit` are legal identifiers. Every
/// other image out of [`sym`] carries a colon and is enclosed. Those two facts
/// together are why a defining label can never collide with a constant, which
/// B.2.10's last clause forbids outright: "No constant with CG name n shall be
/// in the scope associated with some concept with a defining label with CG name
/// n." A defining label here is `Xn`; a constant here begins `i:`.
///
/// # Interpreted names
///
/// A.4.2 says of CLIF, in the 2018 edition as in the first, that "The
/// subdialect of CLIF which does not use numerals or quoted strings is exactly

/// module does not borrow the label. What it does is hold the property: no
/// numeral and no single-quoted string stands anywhere in this output.
///
/// CGIF gets that for free where CLIF could not. A CLIF label has to ride on
/// `cl:comment`, whose argument is a quoted string, so the CLIF writer needs a
