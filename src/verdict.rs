//! Certified verdicts that cannot be spelled without the evidence.
//!
//! Every certified word this engine prints — `model_checked`, the OWL-level
//! `not_entailed_under_unproved_translation`, `preserved_checked`,
//! `preserved_under_supplied_rules_checked`, `checked`, and the theorem names
//! `OOCert.certificate_sound` / `OOCert.horn_certificate_sound` /
//! `Fol.satisfiable_of_check` — is now a variant that CARRIES a [`Certified`],
//! and [`Certified`] has no public constructor. The only value of that type in
//! the whole crate comes out of [`CheckerRun::accepted`], and the only way to
//! obtain a [`CheckerRun`] is [`CheckerRun::spawn`], which runs the checker
//! itself and reads its exit status.
//!
//! # What this replaces
//!
//! Until this module existed the discipline was carried by comments and by
//! tests. Three files each had a line saying "the ONE place this word is
//! produced", and a suite that failed if the word appeared with no exit code
//! behind it. Those tests were right and they still run. But a test only
//! covers the paths someone pointed it at: a new report type that formatted
//! `"model_checked"` in a new module would pass every one of them until
//! somebody noticed and wrote a guard.
//!
//! Now it is a privacy error. `FolVerdict::ModelChecked(..)` cannot be named
//! outside this module without a `Certified`, `Certified` cannot be built
//! outside this module at all, and this module hands one out only after
//! `std::process::Command::output` returned and `ExitStatus::code()` was zero.
//! The compile-fail doctests below are the executable form of that claim; they
//! run under `cargo test` like any other test.
//!
//! # What it does NOT claim
//!
//! Three residual holes, stated rather than papered over.
//!
//! 1. **Which binary ran.** [`CheckerBinary::found_at`] is public and takes
//!    any path, so the wrapper documents where a path is supposed to come from
//!    and does not enforce it; and the discovery routines that call it honour
//!    `$OO_CERT` / `$OO_HORN` / `$OO_FOLMODEL`, so an operator who points one
//!    of those at a script that exits zero gets a certified word for free. The
//!    type system cannot tell a proved-sound Lean binary from a shell builtin.
//!    What it does guarantee is that SOMETHING was executed and exited zero,
//!    which is strictly more than a string literal guarantees, and it is the
//!    property the tests were checking by hand.
//! 2. **Which artefact was accepted.** A [`Certified`] is `Copy`. Code that
//!    ran the checker over goal A could attach the token to goal B. Callers
//!    mint one token per run, inside the arm that owns that run's output, and
//!    the token carries the theorem name so at least the WARRANT cannot drift
//!    from the run that earned it. Binding the token to an artefact digest is
//!    the obvious next tightening and is not done here.
//! 3. **Deserialisation.** None of these verdict types implements
//!    `Deserialize`, deliberately. Reading `"model_checked"` out of somebody
//!    else's JSON is not the same act as earning it, and a `Deserialize` impl
//!    would be a public constructor for every certified variant. Reports are
//!    read back as `serde_json::Value`.
//!
//! # The words that belong to a Lean checker
//!
//! [`CHECKER_OWNED_WORDS`] lists the verdicts the Lean binaries print for
//! themselves. No `word()` in this module returns one, and
//! [`no_engine_word_is_a_checker_word`] asserts that over every vocabulary
//! defined here. Rust states its own words; it quotes the checker's only by
//! echoing bytes it read from the checker's stdout.
