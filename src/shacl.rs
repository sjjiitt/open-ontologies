/// SHACL validator that checks data in a `GraphStore` against SHACL shapes.

/// Shapes are parsed from inline Turtle into a temporary Oxigraph store.
/// Constraints are translated into SPARQL queries run against the main graph.
/// Supports the core constraints `sh:minCount`, `sh:maxCount`, `sh:datatype`,
/// `sh:class`, `sh:pattern`, `sh:hasValue`, `sh:in`, `sh:nodeKind`, `sh:or`,
/// `sh:not`, the inclusive and exclusive range bounds, and SPARQL-based
/// constraints via `sh:sparql`. Apart from `sh:or` and `sh:sparql`, those are
/// read under `sh:property` only: the same predicate asserted directly on the
/// node shape is not evaluated, and the whitelist at the node-shape complement
/// below is what decides that.
///
/// All four target forms select focus nodes: `sh:targetClass` (including the
/// implicit class target), `sh:targetNode`, `sh:targetSubjectsOf` and
/// `sh:targetObjectsOf`.
///
/// Any constraint the validator cannot execute is recorded in
/// `skipped_constraints` and suppresses the conformance verdict: `conforms`
/// becomes null rather than true. That holds wherever the constraint sits: on a
/// property shape (`sh:minLength`, `sh:xone`, a `sh:not` nesting a form that is
/// not evaluated), or on the node shape itself (`sh:closed`, `sh:deactivated`).
/// A target that selects no nodes reaches the same null verdict by the other
/// route, `unmatched_shapes`. Reporting success for rules that were never run is
/// the one failure mode this validator must not have.
///
/// A node shape's OWN constraints (the value constraints asserted on the shape
/// rather than under `sh:property`) are evaluated against the focus node
/// itself, which is what SHACL defines as the value nodes of a node shape:
/// `sh:class`, `sh:datatype`, `sh:nodeKind`, `sh:hasValue`, `sh:in`,
/// `sh:pattern` (with `sh:flags`), `sh:minLength`, `sh:maxLength` and the four
/// range bounds, for every one of the four target forms. Until this existed
/// every one of them was recorded as skipped and 31 of the 32 `core/node`
/// cases in the W3C suite came back UNDETERMINED. The node-level constructs
/// this validator still does not evaluate (`sh:closed`, `sh:not`, `sh:and`,
/// `sh:or`, `sh:xone`, `sh:node`, `sh:languageIn`, `sh:equals`, `sh:disjoint`,
/// the qualified forms) are recorded in `skipped_constraints` whatever target
/// form selected the shape, and suppress the verdict.

        // complement per row recorded `sh:closed` once per target class. It
        // is restricted to discovered shapes, like the property complement:

        // The property-constraint family is exempt ONLY on a shape that carries
        // `sh:path`, because only then is it evaluated, by the property
        // machinery treating the shape as its own property shape. Exempting it
        // unconditionally was a regression measured at once: twenty tests moved
        // out of "undetermined" and into "wrong answer", because the validator
        // stopped saying it had not evaluated a node-level `sh:datatype` and
        // started reporting a clean run instead. The conformance ratchet caught
        // it. A false clean is worse than an honest null, which is the whole
        // reason the third answer exists.
        //
        // deliberately absent: SHACL says a deactivated shape must not be
        // evaluated and this validator evaluates it anyway, so the predicate
        // is not implemented and must reach skipped like any other.
        //
        // Two predicates are exempt at a FALSE value, and only at a false
        // value, because at that value there is nothing left to implement.
        // `sh:closed false` is the SHACL default and imposes no closed-shape
        // restriction; `sh:deactivated false` says evaluate this shape, which
        // is exactly what this validator does. Both are honoured in full, so
        // recording them suppresses the verdict on a run in which nothing was
        // missed. That is a false undetermined, and it costs as much as the
        // false clean this complement exists to prevent: a null that fires on
        // a complete run teaches the reader to ignore null, which destroys
        // the signal the third answer carries. The value is read by value and
        // not by lexical form, so "0"^^xsd:boolean is false like any other
        // spelling. `sh:deactivated true` is unaffected and still reaches
        // skipped, for the reason above.
        //
        // The isLiteral/datatype pair in front of the equality is defensive
        // and, measured on this evaluator, changes no answer today: oxigraph
        // answers `"false"^^xsd:string = false` with false, so an unreadable
        // control stays skipped with or without it. It is kept because SPARQL
        // 1.1 does not require that. RDFterm-equal is a type error on two
        // literals that are neither the same term nor comparable, an error
        // inside FILTER drops the solution rather than failing loudly, and a
        // dropped solution here means a control this validator cannot read
        // never reaches skipped: the false clean, arriving through the one
        // code path written to prevent it, on an evaluator upgrade nobody
        // would think to test for. Testing isLiteral, then the datatype, then
        // the equality keeps every operand of the conjunction false rather
        // than errored, on any evaluator. Being unmutatable is the point of
        // it, so do not delete it for want of a reddening test.
        //
        // `sh:ignoredProperties` is knowingly not exempt and is not
        // whitelisted. It modifies `sh:closed` rather than constraining
        // anything by itself, so wherever it has an effect the shape also
        // carries `sh:closed true`, which is recorded here and suppresses the
        // verdict anyway. Carrying it without that is a shape that asks for
        // nothing, and reporting it costs a report nobody is reading.
