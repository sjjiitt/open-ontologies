//! Does a retrieved slice still support the claims an answer rests on?
//!
//! [`crate::projection_check`] answers "how much of the source neighbourhood
//! survived", which is not the question. A slice at 99% coverage can have
//! dropped the one triple an answer depends on, and a slice at 60% coverage can
//! preserve every conclusion that matters. Worse, the number moves the wrong
//! way: it rises as the projection grows, so a retriever tuned on it learns to
//! fetch MORE rather than to fetch the right thing, and a retrieval-augmented
//! answer grounded in such a slice can be false while every displayed metric is
//! green.
//!
//! This module asks the property instead. Let `G` be the loaded store, `P` the
//! retrieved slice and `Q` a set of ground positive triples the answer rests
//! on. For each `q` in `Q`, does `P` entail `q` exactly when `G` does, decided
//! under ONE pinned rule profile, with a machine-checked certificate for each
//! `q` the projection preserves?
//!
//! # Four cells, and they are four different answers
//!
//! | `G` derives `q` | `P` derives `q` | what it is |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | yes | yes | preserved. The only cell that can carry a certificate. |
//! | yes | no | lost by the projection. The retrieval finding. |
//! | no | yes | the projection is not a subset of the source, or OWL RL monotonicity has been violated and the engine is unsound. Never a retrieval finding. |
//! | no | no | `ungrounded_in_source`. The claim has no support in the graph at all. The fix is in the generator, not the retriever. |
//!
//! The fourth cell is where most of the real value sits, and it is why the two
//! negatives are never collapsed into "loss": a generator that invented a claim
//! and a retriever that dropped a triple have opposite fixes, and a tool that
//! reports both as "not preserved" sends every investigation to the wrong team.
//! `ungrounded_in_source` does NOT mean the claim is false. RDF entailment is
//! open-world and this engine covers 29 of OWL 2 RL's 78 rules, so it means
//! "not derivable from `G` under this profile" and nothing stronger.
//!
//! # Why membership is decided over the certificate FILES
//!
//! [`Reasoner::run_full`] is run twice with `materialize = false` and a
//! `certificate_dir`, and membership of `q` is decided by reading
//! `asserted.tsv` and `derivations.tsv` back off disk rather than by consulting
//! an in-memory closure. That is deliberate. The Lean checker only ever sees
//! those two files. If membership were decided against a set the checker never
//! reads, the engine could report "derived" over a certificate that does not
//! contain the derivation, and the verdict would be unchecked while wearing the
//! checked word. Deciding over the artefact the checker reads makes that class
//! of bug impossible rather than tested against.
//!
//! # The free differential
//!
//! OWL RL is monotone and `P` is a subset of `G`, so every entailment of `P`
//! must be an entailment of `G`. A conclusion of `P` that is not a conclusion of
//! `G` is therefore a SOUNDNESS BUG IN THE ENGINE, not a retrieval finding, and
//! it is reported as `STOP_THE_LINE`. It is worth nothing unless it is DISARMED
//! whenever its premises do not hold, and there are three such conditions, each
//! of which occurs on real input: the projection is not a subset (computed,
//! never assumed from provenance); blank nodes could not be matched; or either
//! run stopped at the iteration cap instead of a fixpoint, which makes the
//! larger closure a LOWER BOUND and manufactures spurious `P`-only entailments.
//! Disarming is reported, never silent.
//!
