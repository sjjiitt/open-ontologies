//! **The verified SHACL evaluator, reachable from a tool.**
//!
//! `Shacl/` holds a mechanised SHACL Core evaluator whose soundness is a
//! machine-checked theorem, `Shacl.validate_spec`, and `oo-shacl` is the binary
//! that runs it. Until this module existed nothing in `src/` mentioned either.
//! A grep for `oo-shacl`, `ShaclMain` or `validate_spec` across the whole crate
//! returned one file, `tests/shacl_core_verified_test.rs`, and that is a test.
//!
//! So the strongest claim in the repository was unreachable from its own
//! interface. `onto_shacl` and the CLI compiled every constraint to SPARQL and
//! handed it to Oxigraph, unverified, with a `skipped_constraints` list; the
//! Lean result was a lab measurement with a binary beside it rather than
//! something a user could obtain. This closes that, behind `verified: true`.
//!
//! # Why a second path rather than a replacement
//!
//! The Rust path answers more. `Shacl/` covers SHACL Core and refuses
//! `sh:sparql` and user-defined components outright, which is 22 of the 120
//! W3C tests; the Rust evaluator runs those and skips others. Neither is a
//! superset, so replacing one with the other would lose answers people depend
//! on. `verified: true` says which question you are asking.
//!
//! # The three exit codes, and why the middle one is the point
//!
//! `oo-shacl` exits 0 with a verdict, 2 when a file could not be read, and 3
//! UNDETERMINED when the shapes graph uses something the development does not
//! implement or the evaluator declined to judge. Three is the code that
//! matters: it is the difference between "everything conforms" and "I did not
//! check everything", and a caller that collapsed them would be doing exactly
//! what the unverified path's `skipped_constraints` list exists to prevent.
//! There is no `conforms: true` on this path that is not covered by the
//! theorem.
//!
//! # The word is earned
//!
//! `ShaclVerified::Checked` carries a [`Certified`], which has no public
//! constructor: the only one in the crate comes out of
//! [`CheckerRun::accepted`] after a process exited zero. The same discipline
//! `src/fol_solve.rs` uses, and for the same reason.
