//! The house rule is that a figure next to the thing it measures must be DERIVED, never
//! typed. A README cannot compute, so the next best thing is a test that refuses to let
//! the two disagree. This is that test.
//!
//! It deliberately checks each stated claim BY ITS SURROUNDING PHRASE rather than

//! counts that are correctly smaller than the total. A test that flagged those would be
//! noise, and a noisy gate gets disabled.

    // The reasoning is the issue's: surface area reads as insecurity, and a
    // number where a purpose belongs tells a visitor nothing about what this is
    // for. A reader who meets "121 tools" before meeting a verb cannot tell
    // whether any of them is the one they need. The front page shows one loop
    // instead, and the breadth moved to docs/tool-reference.md, linked once.
    //
    // The count did not stop being checked, it moved with the claim. The
    // reference page is the catalogue, its job is to be exhaustive, and a
    // catalogue that will not say how long it is is being coy. So the row above
    // guards it there, and `tests/tool_reference_test.rs` additionally checks
    // that the page lists EVERY registered tool and invents none, which is a
    // stronger statement than the total ever was: a page can state 120 and list
    // the wrong 120.
    // The MCP server's instructions string used to be checked here as a literal, and
    // that row is gone on purpose. It stated TWO totals, 114 and 112, and neither was
    // the number the router advertised: a hand-typed figure with a second hand-typed
    // figure beside it, which is the disease this file exists to treat and not a case
    // of it being caught. The string is now formatted from `tool_router.list_all()` at
    // call time, so there is no literal left to go stale, and
