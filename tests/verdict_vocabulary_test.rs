//! The whole certified vocabulary, in one place, checked from outside the crate.
//!
//! `src/verdict.rs` makes a certified verdict unconstructible without evidence:
//! `Certified` has a private field, `CheckerRun::accepted` is its only
//! producer, and the only constructor of a `CheckerRun` spawns a process and
//! reads its exit status. The `compile_fail` doctests in that module are the
//! gate on the CONSTRUCTION side.
//!
//! This file is the gate on the other two sides, and it runs as an ordinary
//! integration test, from outside the crate, where privacy actually applies.
//!
//! 1. **The wire words are pinned as literals.** A rename inside the crate that
//!    changed one of them would change an MCP tool response, a CLI JSON field
//!    and every downstream consumer, silently, because the strings are produced
//!    by `word()` now and not typed at each site. This file types them.
//! 2. **No word the engine states is a word a Lean checker states.** An engine
//!    opinion and a machine-checked result must never share a string, or a
//!    consumer cannot tell them apart. `tests/lean_refutation_producer_test.rs
//!    ::the_engine_never_states_the_checkers_verdict` checks that over a
//!    RESPONSE; this checks it over the vocabulary the responses are drawn
//!    from, so a word added tomorrow is covered before anyone writes a run that
//!    prints it.
//!
//! Where a certified word has to be named, this file EARNS the token the way
//! the engine does: it runs a process that exits zero through the crate's own
//! `run_checker`. There is no other way to get one, which is the point.
