//! **The tool reference lists every tool, and the front page lists none of them.**
//!
//! Issue #196: the README sold surface area. A visitor met four abstract nouns
//! and a tool count before meeting a verb, and could not tell what the thing was
//! for. The breadth is real and it keeps its code; it loses its place above the
//! fold and moves to `docs/tool-reference.md`, linked once, low on the page.
//!
//! A reference page that drifts from the code is worse than no reference page,
//! because it is read as authoritative. These tests are the gate: the page is
//! generated from the `#[tool(...)]` attributes and must stay in step with them.
