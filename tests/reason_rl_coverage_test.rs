//! The ten OWL 2 RL rules added on the `owl-rl-completeness` branch.
//!
//! `tests/lean_certificate_test.rs` already proves that everything the engine
//! emits is accepted by the checker, over the whole shipped corpus. That is a
//! statement about soundness and it says nothing about whether a rule ever
//! fires, whether it fires the right way round, or whether what it adds is
//! worth having. This file covers those three.
//!
//! # What each section is for
//!
//! * **Coverage.** Each of the ten rules fires at least once on an ontology
//!   built for it, and the resulting certificate is accepted. A rule that never
//!   fires is a rule nobody has tested.
//! * **Direction.** `scm-avf2` concludes `?c2 rdfs:subClassOf ?c1` where its
//!   three siblings conclude `?c1 rdfs:subClassOf ?c2`, because a universal
//!   restriction is antitone in its property. The engine must derive the one
//!   and NOT the other, and the checker must reject a forged step that runs the
//!   other way. `OOCert.the_natural_avf2_direction_is_not_entailed` is the same
//!   fact proved against the semantics; this is the same fact observed in the
//!   engine.
//! * **Worth.** The four domain-and-range rules fire on schema alone, so they
//!   fire on every corpus. What they add is completeness of the EMITTED SCHEMA
//!   and not new answers about individuals, because rdfs2 followed by rdfs9
//!   already reached the instance-level consequence. That is a limitation of
//!   the rules rather than a feature, and
//!   `the_domain_rules_add_schema_and_not_answers` is where it is written down
//!   in a form that fails if it stops being true.
//!
//! # These gates were seen to fail
//!
//! A gate nobody has watched fail is decoration, so each of these was broken on
//! purpose and the failure recorded.
//!
//! Changing one character in `src/reason.rs`, `emit((r2, rdfs_subclass, r1),
//! "scm-avf2", ...)` to `emit((r1, rdfs_subclass, r2), ...)`, produced:
//!
//! ```text
//! test scm_avf2_concludes_the_subsumption_the_other_way_round ... FAILED
//!   scm-avf2 must derive `all hasComponent Wheel` subClassOf `all hasPart Wheel`
//! test every_new_rule_fires_and_the_certificate_is_accepted ... FAILED
//!   {"ok":false,"first_rejected":7,"rule":"scm-avf2",
//!    "conclusion":"<http://ex.org/AvfSub> <rdfs:subClassOf> <http://ex.org/AvfSup>"}
//! ```
//!
//! so the engine test and the proved checker both refused it, independently.
//! Flipping the matching Lean condition instead, `avf_sp`'s conclusion from
//! `I.sc c2 c1` to `I.sc c1 c2`, fails the Lean build in three places at once:
//! the `scmAvf2` case of `checkStep_sound`, the model in
//! `OOCert.avf_witness_is_a_model`, and the two `#print axioms` guards that
//! depend on it. The direction is written down in three places and they have to
//! agree.
//!
//! The forged lines in `the_checker_rejects_a_forged_step_for_each_new_rule`
//! are appended one at a time to a certificate that is checked and accepted
//! first, so a rejection there cannot be the checker refusing everything.
