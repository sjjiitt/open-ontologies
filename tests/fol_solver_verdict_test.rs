//! G4. The verdict discipline, and the test that fails if it is ever relaxed.
//!
//! Decision 0006 item 4 fixes five fields and five words, and the reason the
//! whole layer exists is that they are never collapsed into each other. This
//! file is to `src/fol_solve.rs` what
//! `lean_horn_certificate_test.rs::a_user_rule_never_earns_the_absolute_verdict`
//! is to the Horn layer: the guard against laundering something unchecked into
//! something certified.
//!
//! The three mechanical rules, each with its own test and each SHOWN FAILING
//! on input built to break it:
//!
//!   1. **`model_checked` requires `checker_exit == 0`.** There is one branch
//!      in `src/fol_solve.rs` that writes that word and it sits immediately
//!      after reading a zero exit code off `oo-folmodel`.
//!      `an_unchecked_result_never_reports_the_certified_word` drives the
//!      pipeline with a checker that rejects, a checker that cannot read the
//!      file, and no checker at all, and none of the three may reach it.
//!   2. **`unsatisfiable_oracle` requires a run with NO cardinality
//!      constraint.** `a_bounded_unsat_is_not_unsatisfiability` uses the
//!      decision record's own example: `∀x∃y (r(x,y) ∧ x≠y)` is unsat at
//!      carrier 1 and sat at carrier 2, so a driver that mapped the first to
//!      `unsatisfiable_oracle` would report a falsehood from correct solver
//!      output.
//!   3. **`owl_reading` is non-null only when the CHECKER said
//!      `goal_negated_present` and the verdict is `model_checked`.** Read back
//!      out of the checker's own JSON, never from this side's intention.
//!
//! # The stub checkers are the point, not a shortcut
//!
//! Three of these tests hand the pipeline a checker that is not `oo-folmodel`:
//! a script that always rejects, one that always fails to read, and a path
//! that does not exist. That is the only way to exercise the branches a
//! correct solver and a correct checker never take together, and it is exactly
//! the shape of the mistake the rule exists to stop: a pipeline that fell back
//! to the certified word when the checker was unavailable would report
//! `model_checked` on every machine without Lean installed.
//!
//! # G6
//!
//! A missing solver or a missing checker SKIPS LOUDLY with the install line
//! and never passes silently. `common::skip_unless` makes that fatal under
//! `OO_REQUIRE_FIXTURES=1`, and `a_missing_solver_is_loud` drives the real CLI
//! with an empty `PATH` to show the marker on stderr.
