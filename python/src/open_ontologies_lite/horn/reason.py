"""A pure-Python forward chainer that emits a certificate, and states no verdict.

# Why a second untrusted engine is safe

The house rule is that a fast UNTRUSTED engine proposes and a small VERIFIED
checker disposes. The Rust reasoner is untrusted; the certificate carries the
warrant. A second reasoner written in Python is therefore not a new risk: it is
untrusted in exactly the same way, its conclusions carry exactly the same
certificates, and the same Lean theorem checks them. Nothing about the guarantee
weakens, because the guarantee never depended on the engine.

# How independent this engine is from the Rust one, which is less than you think

Not independent. It runs the SAME semi-naive forward-chaining algorithm over the
SAME rule table, it was written with `src/reason.rs` open, and the comments below
cite that file by line number. So what `tools/horn_differential.py` measures when
the two agree is strong evidence about one thing and weak evidence about another,
and the two must not be swapped:

* STRONG against a TRANSCRIPTION slip. An index off by one, a guard dropped, a
  join in the wrong order, a rule arm reading the subject where it meant the
  object. Two people copying one design do not make the same slip twice, and a
  slip on either side shows up as a different derived set.
* CLOSE TO NOTHING against a SHARED MISREADING. If the design itself misreads a
  W3C rule, both engines implement the misreading, agree perfectly, and go on
  agreeing for ever. No number of corpus documents changes that.

The independent leg of that differential is the LEAN CHECKER: written from the
W3C rules, soundness machine-checked, and the only component of the three whose
acceptance means anything on its own. The clean sweep must never be quoted as
"two independent reasoners agree", and the tool prints that sentence next to its
agreement count on every run so it cannot be quoted without it.

# What this module does not decide

It does not print either verdict word and it never will. `oo-horn` decides which
warrant a run earned by comparing the table it was handed against the built-in
one, and a second place where the two could be confused is exactly the hazard
decision 0003 exists to prevent. What this module reports is the table it used,
a hash of it, and where the certificate is.

# The certificate

Three files land in `certificate_dir`:

* `rules.tsv`, the table the run evaluated. The checker is given this rather
  than the user's file, so what it checks and what ran are the same table.
* `asserted.tsv`, every triple the run started from.
* `horn.tsv`, one line per derived triple:
  `ruleIndex TAB bindCount TAB (var TAB term)* TAB cs TAB cp TAB co TAB (ps TAB pp TAB po)*`.

Steps are written in derivation order, and a step's premises are always facts
known before the round that derived it, so every premise is asserted or
concluded by an EARLIER line. That is the ordering `OOCert.checkHornAll`
requires, and it makes a self-citing step structurally impossible rather than
defended against.

Nothing is materialised into the store. A conclusion drawn under a supplied rule
table holds only in models that satisfy that table, and writing it in beside the
assertions is how run N's output becomes run N+1's axiom.
