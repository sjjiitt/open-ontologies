"""Termination, determinism, and which graph the certificate says was asserted.

Three properties, none of which the Lean checker can catch for you.

TERMINATION. There is no iteration cap by default, and there does not need to be
one: `parse_rules` refuses a head variable that does not occur in the body, so no
rule can mint a term, the Herbrand base over the terms in the graph and the table
is finite, and `known` grows monotonically, so the rounds are bounded by the size
of that base. `fixpoint_reached: True` is therefore an earned fact and not a hope.
The Rust `run_full` engine, by contrast, stops at a 64-iteration cap and reports
neither `fixpoint_reached` nor `incomplete`, so a capped run there reports a
number that reads as the closure and is not; `run_horn` gets this right and is
what this engine was copied from.

DETERMINISM. Python randomises string hashing per process, so a candidate list
built by iterating a set gives different bytes on every run. `horn.tsv` is sorted
at the top of each round for exactly that reason, and the test below runs the same
graph through two interpreters with different `PYTHONHASHSEED` and demands
identical bytes.

SCOPE. This is the one that matters most. Until 15 September 2026 the Rust
`run_horn` flattened every named graph into `asserted.tsv`, so a store holding a
previous materialisation in the inferred graph turned derived triples into
ASSERTIONS. The checker could not detect it: the soundness theorem is conditional
on the assertions, and it is TOLD what they are, so the result was a green
absolute verdict about a graph nobody asserted. It now reads
`src/reason.rs:3368`, `graph.triples_in_scope(&scope)`, and the
inferred graph is out of scope.

The two engines still differ in HOW, and the difference is deliberate. Rust
EXCLUDES the inferred graph; this package REFUSES a run that would read it. Both
keep a derived triple out of the asserted set, and refusing is the stricter of
the two, so a graph this package accepts is one the Rust engine would also have
scoped correctly.
